# Welcome! This is my Portfolio

Author: Cody Sanders

This project for me was a deep dive into front-end design. Along the way, I also learned a lot about react hooks, sass, and UI/UX fundamentals. Many commits later, I'm super proud of this portfolio and excited to see where my next projects take me after all the front-end experience I learned.
